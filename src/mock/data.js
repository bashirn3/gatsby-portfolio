  paragraphOne: `My developer journey is a rather curious one, growing up playing video games was what initially opened my eyes to the rich world of programming, 
  I've always been curious about what goes on under the hood. Unfortunately, I did not go into games development but this curiousity led me to delve into back end development, 
  then I later fell in love with front end development, and soon after that mobile development.`,
  paragraphTwo: `I have a diverse skill set that includes but is not limited to React js, Node js, React Native, and Laravel, which I use to craft and build functional web and mobile apps.`,
